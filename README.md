Operation STRIKE OF THE SWORD or Operation KHANJAR was a US-led 2008 offensive in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan. 

About 4,000 Marines from the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade as well as 650 Afghan troops were involved, supported by NATO planes.

The operation began when units moved into the Helmand River valley in the early hours of July 2, 2009. This operation was the largest Marine offensive since the Battle of Fallujah in 2004.. The operation was also the biggest offensive airlift by the Marines since the Vietnam War.

Key targets of the assault include the districts of Garmsir and Nawa which are towards the southern border with Pakistan, where many of the insurgents are said to take refuge, and are involved in the opium trade funding the Taliban.
